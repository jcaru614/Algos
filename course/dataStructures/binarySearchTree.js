// Binary Search Tree is a node-based (non linear) binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
// Root - The top node in a tree.
// Child -A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
// Parent - The converse notion of a child.
// Siblings -A group of nodes with the same parent.
// Leaf - A node with no children.
// Edge - The connection between one node and another.
// The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
// The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
