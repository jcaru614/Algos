// Hash function in Javascript is any function that takes input as arbitrary size data and produces output as fixed-size data.
// the returned value of the hash function is called hash code, hash, or hash value.

// In hashing, all the operations like inserting, searching, and deleting can be performed in O(1) i.e. constant time.
